The goal is to reach the end of the cave without running out of time.  Avoid the red blocks which will try to stop you.  The wind will push you faster through thinner areas of the cave.

Your character begins with a limited amount of "Boost", which allows you to increase or decrease your speed.

Controls:
-Spacebar - restart game
-WASD or arrow keys - move
-Left shift - boost
-Left ctrl - brake
-F1 to F4 - change camera (F1 is default: stationary chase view)

Certain power ups (donut shaped) and power downs (circles) will appear that you can pick up.  These items will effect your move speed and time.
