The goal is to reach the end of the cave.  Avoid the red blocks which will try to stop you.  The wind will push you faster through thinner areas of the cave.

Your character begins with a limited amount of "Boost", which allows you to move and increase or decrease your speed.  If boost runs out you won't be able to move until it recharges, so don't move around for no reason.

Controls:
-Spacebar - restart game
-WASD or arrow keys - move
-Left shift - boost
-Left ctrl - brake
-F1 to F4 - change camera (F1 is default: stationary chase view)

Certain power ups (donut shaped) and power downs (circles) will appear that you can pick up.  These items will effect your move speed, boost rate, and boost recharge.
